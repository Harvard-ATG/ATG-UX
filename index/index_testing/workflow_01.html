                    The primary goal of this initial user research is to learn about faculty's workflow when collecting, organizing and sharing academic material with students.
                    <br>
                    Secondarily, the details of this academic material, whether it is Library material, PDF or Word, Canvas or external links, and more specifically (if applies) images.
                    <br>
                    This first phase of user meetings are not necessarily focused on Media Manager. The next phase may involve user testing on Dev environment user interfaces, prototypes or screen captures.

                    The order of the above tasks is such that if time allows only for the top 3 of 4 questions, most of the objectives of this study would be met.

                    It is not important if users cannot answer all the above questions. Follow up questions such as "If you had to share academic material with students, how would you like to do that?" may still lead to useful findings.
